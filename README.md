*You likely cannot afford a hosting service. In the rare case you can, scroll down for the selfhost guide.*
- Add the bot to your server with this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1374149127725650083&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot
- Type `/setupanonch #channel` to setup anonymous posts. Should be simple after that
- You can disable this at any time with `/removeanonch #channel`
